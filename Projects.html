            <h2><a href="https://github.com/jfk004/Maze">Maze Solver with Recursion</a></h2>
            <p>
                A backtracking maze solver written in Java. It reads a maze from a text file and uses recursion to find a valid path from start to finish.
                Along the way, it marks visited paths and dead ends. This was my first exposure to recursive algorithms and helped build my debugging skills
                for visual problem-solving.

            <h2><a href="https://github.com/jfk004/Connect-Four">Connect Four AI with Alpha-Beta Pruning</a></h2>
            <p>
                Working on a team of 5 we Developed an intelligent Connect Four agent using the minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning.
                Implemented in Java, this AI evaluates game states and chooses optimal moves based on a utility function with depth cutoffs.
                It also includes a variant for 3-player Tic-Tac-Toe using a multiplayer minimax algorithm.
                This project deepened my understanding of AI search strategies and game-tree pruning.

            <h2><a href="https://github.com/ajmccleary/Multi-Player-Trivia-Game">Multiplayer Trivia Game</a></h2>
            <p>This Java-based project is a real-time multiplayer trivia game that uses both TCP and UDP communication.
                It features GUI-based interactions using Swing, a server with concurrent threads to handle multiple clients,
                and a UDP-based polling system that simulates a "buzzer" race to answer questions.
                This project helped me understand concurrency, network programming, and client-server design patterns.
            </p>
            <h2><a href="https://github.com/jfk004/FizzBuzz">FizzBuzz</a></h2>
            <p>
                A classic beginner programming task implemented in Java. This program prints numbers from 1 to 100, 
                replacing multiples of 3 with “Fizz,” multiples of 5 with “Buzz,” and multiples of both with “FizzBuzz.”
                It’s a simple but elegant exercise in control structures and logic that every programmer encounters early on.

            <h2><a href="https://github.com/jfk004/HighAvailabilityCluster">High Availability Cluster Protocol</a></h2>
            <p>
                    Built a custom protocol over UDP to simulate a high availability cluster in both Peer-to-Peer and Client-Server modes.
                    The system detects node failures and recovers from them, while keeping an up-to-date map of shared directories across nodes.
                    The project required low-level socket programming in Java using `DatagramSocket` and `DatagramPacket`,
                    and it reinforced principles of reliability, synchronization, and network resilience.
