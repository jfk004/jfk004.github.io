            Hi, I’m Fahim! I’m currently enrolled in the 3+1 Computer Science program at Quinnipiac University. This means I’m on track to earn both my bachelor’s and master’s degrees in just four years, and I’m loving the challenge and depth it brings.<br><br>

            I got into computer science because I’ve always been fascinated by how things work behind the scenes—especially in games and applications . I wanted to learn how to build cool things from scratch, and that curiosity quickly turned into a passion for coding and problem-solving.<br><br>

            Outside of school, I work as a Front-End Supervisor at Ocean State Job Lot, a local grocery store. Leading a team, interacting with customers, and helping operations run smoothly has taught me a lot about communication, leadership, and multitasking.<br><br>

            When I’m not coding or working, you’ll find me at the gym, out on a trail hiking, or going on walks with my dog . I love staying active and learning new things, whether it's through physical challenges or exploring ideas through reading.<br><br>

            Here is a picture of my dog Rudy:
